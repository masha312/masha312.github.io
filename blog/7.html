      <h1>Navigating the Snack Aisle and Making Healthier Choices</h1>
      <h2>Jul 16, 2019 | 13 min read</h2>

      <article>
        <p>While for many people ingredient lists and nutrition facts are a first go-to destination when it comes to examining any product, some (rightfully so) consider them too intimidating to even look at.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, there are a few simple tips that can make it easier to understand product labels and hence, find healthier packaged foods. So if you have ever felt too overwhelmed walking around the grocery store, you came across the right article :)</p>
        <p>Today, I would like to share four tips I use to find healthier options. We will then look at specific examples for popcorn, chocolate, chips, protein bars, etc. and figure out how we can apply these trips to make a better choice.</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <h3>Tip 1: Don’t pay attention to the wrapper</h3>
        <p>Wrappers are for marketing and attention-grabbing. They are meant to sell you the product and they always highlight only what’s good about the product — if anything at all. Wrappers are subjective.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-1.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-2.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">This brownie claims to be “Better”. Is it though? While it may be allergen-free, it still packs tons of sugar and has too many ingredients.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Never judge a snack by its wrapper.</p>
        <p>To get a more reliable information about a product, you should only refer to the <b>nutrition facts</b> and <b>ingredient list</b>:</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-3.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">rxbar ingredients</div>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-4.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">rxbar nutrition facts</div>
        </div>
        <p>Even though <a href="https://www.berkeleywellness.com/healthy-eating/nutrition/article/can-you-trust-calorie-counts" target="_blank">they may not always be 100% accurate</a>, it’s as close as we can get to the truth. This is still better than blindly trusting buzzwords such as “whole grain”, “protein”, or “fat free” written on the colorful packaging.</p>
        <h3>Tip 2: Check the ingredient list</h3>
        <p>I usually hear two things when it comes to ingredient lists:</p>
        <p><i>“Oh, I don’t understand anything, there are too many unknown words”</i></p>
        <p>or</p>
        <p><i>“It’s too long to read, I don’t have the time for that”</i></p>
        <p>Ingredient lists could be daunting, indeed. Fortunately, there are 2 soft-ish rules to address these problems:</p>
        <p><b>Rule 1</b>: If you don’t understand the ingredients, you probably don’t want to get the product. Things like “maltodextrin” or “carnauba wax” shouldn’t be in your body. Healthy snacks will have ingredients that you recognize or at least, can pronounce.</p>
        <p>Of course, there are exceptions. If all ingredients seem good and there are only one or two which you don’t know, it’s worth looking them up. For example, while “tapioca” or “chicory root” might sound suspicious, they are rather harmless.</p>
        <p><b>Rule 2</b>: If the product’s list is too long to even skim, you probably don’t want to get it either. The longer the list, the higher chances that there are toxicant additives, sweeteners, and colorings.</p>
        <p>Personally, I try to stay away from products that have more than 6–10 ingredients. Once again, sometimes you can run into a good quality product that has a longer ingredient list and that’s okay! In that case, just remember to check the ingredients you don’t recognize.</p>
        <p>It’s important to note that following these two rules will <b>significantly</b> limit your options. However, that’s when <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Choice-Why-More-Less/dp/149151423X" target="_blank">paradox of choice</a> comes into play: the less you have to choose from, the less stressed and overwhelmed you will feel. Needless to say, <a href="https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law" target="_blank">you will save tons of time as well</a>.</p>
        <h3>Tip 3: Look at nutrition facts and check protein %</h3>
        <p>You can derive a lot from nutrition facts. It would take a long time to go through everything, so let’s concentrate on only one part of it — the protein content.</p>
        <p>I assume that if you are looking to eat healthier, there’s a chance you are concerned about protein and want to either increase its intake or at least be aware of its content in products.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, a product that claims to be “high in protein” on the wrapper should have a minimum of 20% protein. Otherwise, it’s just another marketing trick. To calculate protein %, follow the following formula:</p>
        <p><i>( [grams of protein x 4] / [total calories] ) x 100 = protein %</i></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Find grams of protein (usually at the bottom of the label)</li>
          <li>Multiply that number by 4 to get a total number of calories from protein</li>
          <li>Locate the total number of calories (usually the largest number on the label)</li>
          <li>Divide protein calories by total to get protein %</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-5.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">EPIC bar</div>
        </div>
        <p>For example, EPIC bar contains 12g of protein, which means that 12g x 4 = 48 calories come from protein. The total calories is 210, so protein content is about 48/210 = 0.228 or 23%.</p>
        <p>Although counting might be tedious at first, you will get more comfortable with it as you practice. Moreover, it’s not like you will always have to count. Soon enough, you will be able to tell right away that a 200 calorie product with 14 grams of protein is a better protein option than a 250 calorie product with 4 grams of protein.</p>
        <h3>Tip 4: Try to stay away from flavors</h3>
        <p>Even brands that generally use cleaner ingredients tend to go downhill when it comes to flavors. Flavored products usually have way more additives than their plain counterparts and the fancier the flavor is, the higher chance that it’ll have more undesirable ingredients (for example, cookies and cream popcorn will probably have more additives than butter popcorn).</p>
        <p>Just like tip #2, this one will limit your choices. While it may be hard to part with your favorite flavors at first, it will make your life easier in the end.</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>Now it’s time to put this theory into practice! Let’s look at these popular snacks:</p>
        <h3>Chocolate</h3>
        <h4>Example 1 — Ritter Sport</h4>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-6.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-7.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">Milk chocolate with butter biscuit. Ingredients: sugar, palm fat, cocoa butter, chocolate liquor, wheat flour, lactose, milk, skim milk, cream, butterfat, butter, soy lecithin, wheat starch, glucose-fructose syrup, salt, whey, natural bourbon vanilla flavor.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Let me begin by saying that I <b>love</b> Ritter Sport. It has been my favorite chocolate since childhood and, judging by its wrapper, I have always thought that it is a good quality product. I was quite upset when I found out otherwise.</p>
        <p>Even though the wrapper says <i>Fine quality European chocolate made with natural ingredients</i>, the ingredient list says the opposite. “Palm fat” or “glucose-fructose corn syrup” are not what I envision when I think of “quality” or “natural”.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, Ritter Sport milk chocolate has way fewer ingredients and doesn’t contain neither palm fat nor corn syrup. Therefore, if picking between the two, opting for the simple milk chocolate would be a better option.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-8.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-9.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">Alpine milk chocolate. Ingredients: sugar, milk, cocoa butter, chocolate liquor, hazelnut paste, soy lecithin.</div>
        </div>
        <h4>Example 2 — Tony’s Chocolonely</h4>
        <p>It addition to having a short list of clean ingredients, Tony’s Chocolonely also tastes great. Moreover, even their flavored option doesn’t have any undesirable additives.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-10.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-11.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">Milk chocolate. Ingredients: sugar, dry whole milk, cocoa mass, soy lecithin.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-12.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-13.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">Dark chocolate almond sea salt. Ingredients: cocoa mass, sugar, almond, cocoa butter, sea salt, soy lecithin.</div>
        </div>
        <h3>Popcorn</h3>
        <p>Even though popcorn is known as one of the healthier snacks, it’s still worth to check the ingredients. Ideally, it should only have three: popcorn, oil, and salt.</p>
        <h4>Example 1 — Smartfood</h4>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-14.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-15.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">White cheddar. Ingredients: popcorn, vegetable oil (corn, canola, and/or Sunflower Oil), Cheddar Cheese (Milk, Cheese Cultures, Salt, Enzymes), Whey, Buttermilk, Natural flavor, and Salt.</div>
        </div>
        <p>First of all, the brand’s name, <i>Smartfood</i>, could trick one into thinking that they are making a “smarter” choice. However, we already know that wrappers could be misleading.</p>
        <p>Second, despite the fact that White Cheddar is Smartfood’s most popular flavor, it’s not the best option — there are way more than three necessary ingredients. Could their less popular options be better though?</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-16.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-17.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">Sea Salt. Ingredients: Popcorn, Expeller-Pressed Sunflower Oil, and Sea Salt.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Turns out, yes. Their Smartfood Delight Sea Salt flavor only contains popcorn, expeller-pressed sunflower oil, and sea salt.</p>
        <p>It’s also important to mention that “Delight” stands for their “reduced fat” option. While many brands will have “lighter” versions of their most popular products, we shouldn’t automatically assume that those versions will be better. Just remember to always keep tip #1 in mind and look at the nutrition label.</p>
        <p>For example, here’s another Smartfood Delight flavor:</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-18.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-19.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">White cheddar. Ingredients: Popcorn, Vegetable Oil, Maltodextrin, Reduced Lactose Whey, Cheddar Cheese, Salt, Whey Protein Concentrate, Whey, Natural Flavors, Butermilk, Potassium Chloride, Lactic Acid, and Citric Acid.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Even though it is indeed lighter in fats (5g per serving vs 10g per serving) than the regular White Cheddar, it’s still similar in calories (130 cals vs 160 cals) and has quite a few ingredients.</p>
        <p>Unless your goal is to specifically cut out fats from your diet, “lighter” versions are often not worth it. Smaller fat content is usually made up by an increased portion of carbohydrates.</p>
        <h4>Example 2 — BoomChickaPop</h4>
        <p>BoomChickaPop takes pride in using “real, simple ingredients” and markets itself accordingly. However, it’s still worth to check the ingredients, especially for the flavored options.</p>
        <p>Like most other brands’, their Sea Salt popcorn only contains three ingredients and would be a good option to pick.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-20.png"/>
          <div class="caption">Sea Salt. Ingredients: popcorn, sunflower oil, sea salt</div>
        </div>
        <p>If you are craving something sweeter, their Sweet & Salty Kettlecorn only contains four ingredients (popcorn, sunflower oil, cane sugar, sea salt). While this flavor does contain sugar, it’s still a better option than other sweet flavors such as Cinnamon Roll Drizzled Kettlecorn or Milk Chocolaty Peanut Butter Kettlecorn. In addition to sugar, these flavors contain quite a few other additives.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-21.png"/>
          <div class="caption">Sweet & Salty. Ingredients: popcorn, sunflower oil, cane sugar, sea salt.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-22.png"/>
          <div class="caption">Cinnamon Roll. Ingredients: cane sugar, popcorn, sunflower oil, palm kernel oil, nonfat milk solids, cinnamon, natural flavors, soy lecithin, salt, paprika extract</div>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-23.png"/>
          <div class="caption">Milk Chocolaty Peanut Butter. Ingredients: cane sugar, popcorn, palm kernel oil, peanut flour, nonfat dry milk, sea salt, cocoa powder, peanut oil, soy lecithin.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Lastly, there are flavors which I wouldn’t consider neither “real” nor “simple”. For example, here are the ingredients for the Chile Lime flavor:</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-24.png"/>
          <div class="caption">Chile Lime. Ingredients: popcorn, sunflower oil, chile lime seasoning (cane sugar, spices, sea salt, citric acid, vinegar powder [rice maltodextrin, white distilled vingegar], corn maltodextrin, yeast extract, paprika, natural flavors).</div>
        </div>
        <h3>Tortilla chips</h3>
        <p>Just like popcorn, tortilla chips should only have three ingredients: corn, oil, and salt.</p>
        <h4>Example 1 — Late July</h4>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-25.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-26.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">Late July Sea Salt. Ingredients: organic whole ground corn, organic sunflower and/or safflower oil, sea salt.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Late July is one of my favorites. It only contains 3 ingredients, and all of which are organic (if you care about that stuff).</p>
        <h4>Example 2 — Tortiyahs</h4>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-27.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-28.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">Tortiyahs Cantina Style. Ingredients: mass flour, vegetable oil, salt, sugar, onion powder, spice, garlic powder, dehydrated red bell pepper, tomato powder, maltodextrin, dehydrated green bell pepper, autolized yeast extract, natural flavor, citric acid, paprika oleorosin, torula yeast, smoke flavoring.</div>
        </div>
        <p>That’s a lot of unfamiliar and unnecessary ingredients! I would definitely pass on this one.</p>
        <h4>Example 3 — Beanitos</h4>
        <p>Typically, tortilla chips are made of corn, which makes them a good source of carbohydrates and not a very good source of protein. If you look at the protein content on the Late July nutrition label, you’ll see that it’s only 2g per serving, compared with 17g of carbs.</p>
        <p>However, if you are looking to increase your protein and lower carbs, it doesn’t mean that you have to give up tortilla chips. Fortunately, there are options available which can help you meet your goals while still enjoying your favorite snack.</p>
        <p>One of those options is Beanitos— tortilla chips made from beans.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-29.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-30.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">Beanitos Restaurant Style. Ingredients: whole great northern beans, sunflower oil, rice flour, tapioca starch, sea salt.</div>
        </div>
        <p>As you can see, there are 14g carbs and 5g protein per serving, which makes up 15% of total calories. While it’s not a high-protein snack, it is still a better option than regular tortilla chips, where protein is only ~ 6% of total calories.</p>
        <p>Although I love regular Beanitos, I wouldn’t go for their flavored options:</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-31.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-32.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">Beanitos Sweet Chili and Sour Cream. Ingredients: whole great northern beans, sunflower oil, long grain rice flour, tapioca starch, cane sugar, buttermilk powder, sea salt, whey powder, sour cream, dextrose, onion powder, spices, citric acid, nonfat dry milk, garlic powder, non-gmo natural flavor, natural extractives of paprika.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Even though it still has 5g of protein, it contains way too many ingredients, including sugar and dextrose. I have nothing against sugar in products that are <i>meant</i> to be sweet (chocolate, cookies. etc.). Tortilla chips, however, aren’t on that list.</p>
        <h3>Trail mix</h3>
        <p>The higher variety of nuts, raisins, chocolate, pretzels, etc. is in the trail mix, the higher chances that it has added oils and sugars. Simple nut mixes are usually a safer option.</p>
        <h4>Example 1 — Planters</h4>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-33.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-34.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">Planters Nuts & Chocolate. Ingredients: peanuts, m&m’s milk chocolate candies (sugar, chocolate, skim milk, cocoa butter, lactose, milkfat, soy lecithin, salt, artificial flavors, sugar, cornstarch, corn syrup, dextrin, coloring, gum acacia), raisins, almonds, peanut oil, sea salt, high oleic sunflower oil.</div>
        </div>
        <p>This one has every ingredient you should avoid (mostly coming from m&m’s) — oils, colorings, syrups. Trail mixes such as this one do you more harm than good, so it’s better to skip on those.</p>
        <h4>Example 2 — Back to Nature</h4>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-35.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-36.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">Back to Nature Cashew Almond Pistachio. Ingredients: cashews, almonds, pistachios, sea salt.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Although this one may not be as fun, it contains only 4 ingredients: cashews, almonds, pistachios, sea salt. It’s rare to find trail mixes without any added oils, so this is a great option.</p>
        <h4>Example 3 — Second Nature</h4>
        <p>What if you like to have something else other than nuts in your trail mix? You can still find good options! The only problem is that they are not as common as the ones with extra additives.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-37.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-38.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">Second Nature Coconut Almond Medley. Ingredients: almonds (almonds, peanut and/or sunflower oil, salt), dark chocolate chunks (sugar, chocolate, liquor, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, salt and vanilla), coconut slices (fresh coconut meat, cane sugar, sea salt).</div>
        </div>
        <p>This one contains roughly 3 ingredients (almonds, coconut, chocolate) and although there is added oil in almonds and sugar in coconut chunks, it’s still a much better option than Planters.</p>
        <p>Aside: in fact, the perfect trail mix is the one you make yourself! This is a guaranteed way to avoid any additives while perfecting it to your own taste.</p>
        <h3>Protein Bars</h3>
        <p>Protein bars should be high in protein. Boom.</p>
        <p>While this seems like an obvious statement, there are way too many bars out there that merely have “protein” written on the wrapper.</p>
        <h4>Example 1 — Kind</h4>

          <div class="caption">Kind Toasted Caramel Nut. Ingredients: peanuts, almonds, glucose syrup, soy protein isolate, honey, chicory root fiber, palm kernel oil, sugar, milk powder, soy lecithin, natural flavor, carob powder, salt, annatto.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Although this Kind bar might have more protein content than other Kind bars, it’s not a high-protein bar. Protein makes up 19% of calories and while it’s not the worst option, there are more protein-rich bars out there.</p>
        <h4>Example 2 — Go Macro</h4>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-41.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-42.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">GoMacro. Ingredients: organic brown rice syrup, organic almond butter, organic protein blend (organic sprouted brown rice protein, organic pea protein), organic puffed brown rice, organic fair-trade chocolate chips (organic coconut sugar, organic cocoa, organic cocoa butter), organic unsweetened coconut, organic almonds.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Same deal here. This GoMacro bar is higher in protein compared to other GoMacro bars, not to other protein bars. It contains only 15% protein.</p>
        <p>However, it’s worth to mention that GoMacro bars are made out of good ingredients, which makes them a great snacking option overall.</p>
        <h4>Example 3 — rxbar</h4>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-43.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-44.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">rxbar Peanut Butter. Ingredients: dates, peanuts, egg whites, natural flavors, sea salt.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Going back to rxbars — I think it’s one of the best protein bars out there. Every flavor is 200–220 calories with ~12g of protein (21–24% of total calories).</p>
        <p>Moreover, it indeed has simple and natural ingredients. This is still important to note, even if you are primarily concerned about protein.</p>
        <h4>Example 4 — Think!</h4>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 240px" src="images/7-45.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 240px" src="images/7-46.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">Think! Brownie Crunch. Ingredients: protein blend (soy protein isolate, calcium caseinate, whey protein isolate), maltitol syrup, vegetable glycerin, water, almond butter, cocoa butter, alkalized cocoa, chocolate, sunflower oil, lecithin, sodium, caseinate, natural flavor, tapioca starch, milk fat, salt.</div>
        </div>
        <p>While Think! bar has ~ 34% protein, it’s not the best option when it comes to ingredients. Therefore, I would rather choose a bar with less protein % and cleaner ingredients over this one.</p>
        <h4>Example 5 — Oatmega</h4>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-47.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-48.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">Oatmega Chocolate Brownie. Ingredients: Grass-Fed Whey Protein Concentrate, Chicory Root Fiber, Whey Protein Crisp (Whey Protein Isolate, Whey Protein Concentrate, Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, Calcium Carbonate), Gluten-Free Oats, Vegetable Glycerin, Tapioca Syrup, Sugar, Sunflower Oil, Almonds, Chocolate Liquor, Responsibly-Caught Fish Oil (Anchovy, Sardine, Tilapia), Cocoa Powder, Natural Flavors, Cocoa Butter, Soy Lecithin, Sea Salt, Monk Fruit Extract.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Oatmega is another one of my favorites. It contains good ingredients and every flavor is 200 calories, with 14g protein (24%).<p>
        <h3>Pretzels</h3>
        <p>And lastly, pretzels. My favorite snack of all time. There are hundreds of different pretzels out there and yet, most of them are not good at all :(.</p>
        <h4>Example 1 — Snyder’s</h4>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-49.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-50.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">Snyder’s. Ingredients: enriched flour (wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid), water, canola oil, malt (tapioca syrup, malt extract), salt, yeast, soda.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Snyder’s pretzels contain enriched flour, which carries no nutritional value and can have <a href="https://www.joshgitalis.com/dark-side-white-sugar-flour/" target="_blank">numerous health implications</a>. Generally speaking, it’s best to avoid anything with enriched flour — not just pretzels.</p>
        <p>The bad news is that most popular brands use enriched flour, which makes it nearly impossible to find a good bag of pretzels. I once counted 40 different kinds of pretzels at my grocery store (yeah, I have nothing better to do with my life) and 37 of them had enriched flour as their main ingredient.</p>
        <h4>Example 2 — Unique Pretzels</h4>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-51.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/7-52.jpeg"/>
          <div class="caption">Unique Sprouted “Splits”. Ingredients: organic sprouted 100% whole wheat flour, organic extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, soda and organic yeast.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Not all is lost though! Fortunately, there are brands like Unique Pretzels, which use whole wheat flour and, I think, taste even better that any popular brand. 🥨</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>That's it! Hopefully you learned something new :) </p>
        <p>P.S. It's important to note that products with better ingredients are generally more expensive and are not available at every grocery store, which makes their access limited to many. Junk food, unfortunately, is everywhere.
