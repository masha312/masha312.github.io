          <p>Back in September, I joined LogicManager as a Software Engineering Intern. As evident from the job title, design wasn’t a part of my responsibilities, but I have always had interest in it. I let my team know that if there was ever a need for a spec, I would be happy to give it a try. Since there was not a dedicated UI designer (all previous specs were done by the Marketing team), I didn’t have to wait long—it only took 4 weeks to get my first design task!</p>
          <p>Our product manager asked me and my coworker Alex to mock up a confirmation alert for our application. Given that it was our first alert design ever, it would become a trendsetter for all other types of alerts in the app. Obviously, I was hyped to get started! I should have been horrified, too, but that’s a story for another time.</p>
          <p>Prior to designing the alert, I have done other designs either for school projects or myself. Since I already had familiarity with a variety of Adobe products, I always used Adobe XD as my design tool. Initially, I was going to use XD for the alert project as well, but then I thought it might be a good idea to check out other alternatives. While I didn’t have much prior collaborative design experience, I still anticipated that there would be a lot of revising and editing and I wasn’t looking forward to numerous exports, searches for the most recent version, and file names such as “final design (10)”.</p>
          <p>I wasn’t familiar with Figma at the time, but I remembered glancing over <a href="https://t.me/designsystemfigma" target="_blank"> Rubik’s blog</a> in Telegram, about building a design system in Figma. I didn’t remember much, but a few words were stuck in my head: “browser”, “sharing”, and “easy”.</p>
          <p>So, I decided to find out what Figma was all about. After browsing their website for 5 minutes, I understood two things:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>It has all the same tools as Adobe XD.</li>
            <li>Instead of exporting and emailing/Slacking the file to Alex, I can just send him a link. Moreover, we can even work on the design at the same time if we wanted to.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>That was enough to convince me to create an account and get started with our first design in Figma.</p>
          <p>I am not going to go into details of designing alerts in Figma, but I have to say that Figma did what it promised: it was easy to share, edit, and there was never a doubt about the final spec’s location.</p>
          <p>After we completed the alert design, we got a new request for a table component. Since we didn’t have a reason to switch our design tools, we continued working in Figma. At that time, I knew that I would never want to go back. Figma took the mundane out of the design process, allowing us to dedicate our time to creating and brainstorming design solutions. In addition, it improved the development process as well. Developers no longer had to worry about locating the last version of the file and could work with high quality specs instead of exported png’s.</p>
          <p>It has been several months now and today, our design specs officially live in Figma — labeled by their corresponding JIRA issues and neatly organized into projects. Over the past several months we have also been slowly creating our component library, which also has its dedicated space in Figma. All developers and product managers now have viewer accounts and are always able to access the latest version of the spec for any project, which is especially helpful during testing, sprint planning, grooming, and business meetings.</p>
          <p>While our workflow with Figma is good, it’s not yet ideal and there are a few things we can improve on to make it even smoother for everyone involved. As we move forward, I am excited to continue working in Figma and seeing how else we can utilize its features to enhance our design process and deliver a quality product.</p>
