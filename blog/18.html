      <h1>Experiment: How I Increased My Strength By ~30% In Just 2 Weeks</h1>

      <article>
        <h4>Some background</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I’m 23, female, around 116lb and 18–19% body fat.</li>
          <li>I began my working out journey about four years ago and have been consistently doing circuit strength training for about eight months.</li>
          <li>I’ve been tracking my nutrition for about two years, with primary focus on protein and fat intake.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>About a month ago I have noticed that with each workout, it became harder and harder for me to increase weights. Prior to that, I consistently kept on going up by about 2.5–7.5lb every 1–2 weeks. However, once I got up to using ~30lb for most upper body exercises, I began to struggle with going any heavier than that.</p>
        <p>My weight also started climbing slowly — I went from 113.6lb weekly average to about 116.6lb, even though my diet remained the same.</p>
        <h3>Plan of action</h3>
        <p>To tackle my plateau, I thought it would be fun to run a small 30-day experiment. I decided to reevaluate my nutrition and see whether slightly altering my diet will set me back on track. I decided not to make any adjustments to my training program, because I wanted to ensure that changes (if there would be any) would only come as a result of changing my diet.</p>
        <p>Here’s what my macros and nutrients looked like before the experiment:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Protein — 100g daily average (28%)</li>
          <li>Fat — 33g daily average (21%)</li>
          <li>Carbs — 178g daily average (51%)</li>
          <li>Fiber — 38g daily average</li>
          <li>Sodium — 1121mg daily average</li>
          <li>Potassium — 1693mg daily average</li>
          <li>Sugar — 111g daily average</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on these, I planned to make just the following two adjustments:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Increase protein by about 30g (to 130g daily average)</li>
          <li>Decrease sugar by as much as I possibly could</li>
        </ol>
        <p>#2 deserves a special explanation. Even though I don’t eat sweets often, I am a huge fruit addict. Apples, oranges, grapes… I will have it all. I understand that fruit is much better for you than sweets but nevertheless, eating ten apples a day just can’t be good. So yeah, that’s where my ~100 grams of sugar per day came from.</p>
        <p>For the next 30 days, I aimed to replace fruit with cucumbers, bell peppers, and other veggies. (I expected this to be very, VERY hard).</p>
        <p>I estimated that my caloric intake will stay roughly the same, 1400–1700 per day, given that I will be eating less sugar (so extra protein will make up for less carbs).</p>
        <h3>Measuring progress</h3>
        <p>To test my progress, I decided to do the same workout at the beginning of the experiment, in the middle (2 weeks later), and at the end (4 weeks later).</p>
        <p>Here’s the workout and my weights at the beginning:</p>
        <h4>Part 1 (4 rounds)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Shoulder press — 10 x 30lb</li>
          <li>Bent shoulder raises — 20 x 20lb</li>
          <li>Bicep curl pulses — 20 x 30lb</li>
          <li>Bicep curl to shoulder press — 10 x 30lb</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Part 2 (as many rounds as possible in 10 minutes — I did 5)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Squat to overhead press — 8 x 30lb</li>
          <li>Decline pushup — 8</li>
          <li>Lateral raise — 8 x 20lb</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Results (so far)</h3>
        <p>To be honest, I didn’t expect to see any significant results only halfway into the experiment. However, when I repeated the workout two weeks later, I was quite amazed.</p>
        <p>First though, here’s the rundown of my nutrition over these past two weeks, compared to the beginning of the experiment:</p>

        </div>
            <p>As you can see, I did manage to hit my two goals — upping my protein (although not as much as I intended to) and lowering down sugars (by a significant amount!). However, I also increased my sodium intake which I wasn’t happy about. Potassium levels also seem alarmingly low.</p>
        <p>And the most important, here’s my workout progress:</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img src="images/18-2.png"/>
          <p class="caption">🎉🎉🎉</p>
        </div>
        <p>The surprising part was that using heavier dumbbells didn’t feel much harder. In fact, it felt just right — the same way that my old weights felt two weeks prior.</p>
        <p>Also, I should note that I repeated the workout at exactly the same time of the day (early morning) and got about the same amount of sleep both nights. So, I think it’s safe to say that my progress came as a result of the diet adjustments :)</p>
        <p>In addition to the gains, I also noticed a few other unexpected results:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> My weight dropped a little bit from 116.6lb average to 115.4lb</li>
          <li>My resting heart rate also dropped from 50 to 44</li>
          <li>I started falling asleep much faster and I feel that I’m sleeping deeper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
        <p>While these changes worked for me, they may not work for everyone. There’s also evidence that high-protein diets may lead to certain health implications so it’s always best to consult a doctor before making any significant changes to your nutrition.</p>
        <p>Given the above, this type of diet is not something that I plan on doing long term. After my experiment is over, I plan to lower protein and monitor my sodium intake better. Also, I really miss apples and want to bring them back into my diet — although in smaller amounts than before.🍎</p>
