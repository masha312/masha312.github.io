      <h1>UX Design: Nutrition Calculators</h1>

      <article>
        <p>As somebody who likes to keep track of calories and macros, I love it when restaurants publish their nutrition info online and even more so, make it easy to customize your order while staying aware of nutritional value.</p>
        <p>In fact, whenever I eat out, I usually pick a place based on whether its nutritional facts are accessible online. (Obviously I don‚Äôt do this ALL the time. Only when I‚Äôm by myself and/or it‚Äôs a weekday üôÉ).</p>
        <p>Since I have been tracking for quite a while now, I‚Äôve come across numerous approaches to designing nutrition calculators. There are some great examples out there and I am happy to share my favorite ones in this article.</p>
        <h3>Sweetgreen</h3>
        <p>Sweetgreen app probably has many fans in both UX and health/fitness communities.</p>
        <p>The interface is clean, customization and ordering process is fast, and the pictures of ingredients are just so aesthetically pleasing.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 240px" src="images/12-1.gif"/>
          <div class="caption">Online ordering on the Sweetgreen app</div>
        </div>
        <p>As seen above, total calories update as you modify your meal and the calorie calculator is conveniently integrated right in ordering.<p>
        <p>However, there are a few downsides. First, there is no macro information in the application. Although I found a <a href="https://www.sweetgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/S118-Nutrition-12.5.17.pdf" target="_blank">pdf table online with macro breakdowns</a> for each menu item, it appears to be inconsistent with the app and has not been updated with the most recent items.</p>
        <p>Second, ordering (and therefore, ability to customize and check nutritional info) is available on the app only. There‚Äôs no way to do it on the website, either from your phone or desktop.</p>
        <p>Third, even though it‚Äôs great that nutrition calculator is integrated in the ordering, there‚Äôs a chance that a user is only interested in browsing nutrition information without placing an order. As <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/7-great-and-not-so-great-user-experiences-aaba569a657" target="_blank">I‚Äôve written before</a>, it could be beneficial for users to have access to a restaurant‚Äôs menu (and in this case, nutritional info) even if they are not ready to order yet.</p>
        <h3>Chipotle</h3>
        <p>Unlike Sweetgreen, Chipotle has a separate nutrition calculator feature that also shows macro breakdown. While it‚Äôs not accessible in the app, you can use it either on the mobile or desktop version of the website.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/12-2.gif"/>
          <div class="caption">Desktop version of Chipotle nutrition calculator</div>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/12-3.png"/>
          <div class="caption">Clicking on an individual ingredient‚Äôs calories expands a label with detailed macro info</div>
        </div>
        <p>On the desktop version of Chipotle nutrition calculator, there‚Äôs a fixed side panel with a nice pie chart that gets updated as you select the ingredients.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 240px" src="images/12-4.gif"/>
          <div class="caption">Mobile version of Chipotle nutrition calculator</div>
        </div>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 240px" src="images/12-5.png"/>
          <div class="caption">Clicking on an individual ingredient‚Äôs calories on mobile also expands a label with detailed macro info</div>
        </div>
        <p>On the mobile version, there‚Äôs a fixed bar at the bottom that shows nutrition information. When you tap on it, it displays a pie chart just like the desktop version:</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 240px" src="images/12-6.png"/>
          <div class="caption">Mobile version of Chipotle nutrition calculator</div>
        </div>
        <p>When you place an actual online order, Chipotle shows calorie count for each ingredient. However, it no longer shows the macro breakdown and doesn‚Äôt calculate the total sum of calories as you update your order.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 240px" src="images/12-7.gif"/>
          <div class="caption">Ordering on the Chipotle app</div>
        </div>
        <h3>CAVA</h3>
        <p>Like Chipotle, CAVA has a nutrition calculator that‚Äôs accessible on the mobile and desktop version of the website and not on the app.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/12-8.gif"/>
          <div class="caption">Desktop version of CAVA nutrition calculator</div>
        </div>
        <p>Their desktop version also has a fixed panel on the right side that updates nutrition information as you select the ingredients.</p>
        <p>Hovering over the ‚Äú+‚Äù on each item displays a label with detailed nutritional info for that specific item.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/12-9.png"/>
          <div class="caption">Nutrition facts label for an individual item (desktop version)</div>
        </div>
        <p>Compared to Chipotle, however, their mobile version is lacking.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 240px" src="images/12-10.gif"/>
          <div class="caption">Mobile version of CAVA nutrition calculator</div>
        </div>
        <p>As you select ingredients, you have no idea what they add up to unless you scroll all the way down to the bottom. A fixed bar would definitely come in handy here.</p>
        <p>It‚Äôs also hard to check an individual item‚Äôs label. In order to do that, you need to tap the little ‚Äú+‚Äù in the right hand corner. Since the ‚Äú+‚Äù button is very small, it‚Äôs easy to accidentally select (or deselect) an item while checking the label.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 240px" src="images/12-11.png"/>
          <div class="caption">Nutrition facts label for an individual item (mobile version, CAVA)</div>
        </div>
        <p>Although Chipotle employs the same principle for opening a single ingredient‚Äôs nutrition label, you can tap either # of calories, word ‚Äúcalories‚Äù, or the arrow to open or close the label. Since the tappable area is a bit bigger, it‚Äôs not as easy to accidentally to select or deselect the ingredient.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 240px" src="images/12-12.png"/>
          <div class="caption">Nutrition facts label for an individual item (mobile version, Chipotle)</div>
        </div>
        <p>When you place an order online, CAVA doesn‚Äôt show calories for each item separately. However, as you add ingredients to your order you see the total calories for the meal.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 240px" src="images/12-13.gif"/>
          <div class="caption">Ordering on the CAVA app</div>
        </div>
        <h3>Panera Bread</h3>
        <p>Panera has a nutrition calculator (that includes both calories and macros) integrated in their ordering process.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images/12-14.gif"/>
          <div class="caption">Ordering on Panera website (desktop version)</div>
        </div>
        <p>When you order on their desktop website, calories update as you customize your meal. Clicking on ‚Äúnutrition info‚Äù also opens up a popup with detailed macro information. The popup stays open as you keep modifying your order, which is convenient since you don‚Äôt have to go back and forth to check macros.</p>
        <p>The mobile version of their website is similar to the desktop one ‚Äî it has the same UI and features. However, it doesn‚Äôt look very responsive.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 240px" src="images/12-15.gif"/>
          <div class="caption">Mobile version looks a little squished‚Ä¶ maybe it looks better on bigger phones (I still have a 5s)</div>
        </div>
        <p>Fortunately though, Panera has a very user friendly app, so you don‚Äôt even have to use the mobile version when ordering on the go.</p>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 240px" src="images/12-16.gif"/>
          <div class="caption">Ordering on the Panera app</div>
        </div>
        <p>While the app offers the same features, it has a more appealing interface that provides a much smoother user experience. One difference is that you don‚Äôt see the macros update right away, only after you finish customizing the order.</p>
        <p>It‚Äôs also worth noting that of all the mentioned restaurants, Panera allows the most flexibility for customizing the portion size. For every ingredient in the meal, you can choose either Light, Regular, or Extra, and the nutrition info will update accordingly. This feature is available on all desktop, mobile, and app ordering.</p>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Based on the above examples, let‚Äôs compile a list of suggestions for nutrition calculator best practices:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Consider integrating complete nutrition calculator (calories, macros) into the ordering process.
          <li>At the same time, also consider having a standalone nutrition calculator feature.
          <li>Include calories for each menu item/ingredient.</li>
          <li>Include macros for each menu item/ingredient.</li>
          <li>Display calories for the entire order (or at the very least, for each separate menu item).</li>
          <li>Update calories and macros as the user customizes their order.</li>
          <li>Keep calories and macros information visible as the user customizes their order.</li>
          <li>Make sure nutrition calculator (whether it‚Äôs a separate feature or if it‚Äôs integrated with ordering) is accessible via the app and on the website (both mobile and desktop versions).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Of course, as seen in cases above, not every single one of these has to be implemented in order to have a great app! These suggestions are solely based on my opinion and what I personally find helpful to stay on track with my goals.</p>
