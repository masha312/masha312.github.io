        <p>It’s not a secret that the best interfaces are unnoticeable — they smoothly guide users towards their goals and help them to successfully accomplish tasks. As a designer, however, I love spotting and appreciating examples of good UX in the apps I use daily. And of course, as a user, I sometimes find myself in frustrating situations, caused by confusing interfaces. Today, I would like to share a few great and not-so-great UX examples I came across recently.</p>
        <h3>First, the good ones:</h3>
        <h4>1. Strava</h4>
        <p>To switch between km and miles, you only need to go to the settings and tap “Units of Measurement”. Other apps would either bring you to a new screen or open up an overlay, but Strava proves that’s absolutely unnecessary. Since you can only choose between two options, why not just toggle them? So neat.<p>

          <div class="caption">Toggling between kilometers and miles</div>
        </div>
        <h4>2. FatSecret</h4>
        <p>FatSecret is an app that lets you track your calories, macros, and weight. Up until recently, if you wanted to log in food, you could only use a scrollable list to pick the amount. While scrollable lists are fine if you’re working with a smaller range of numbers (for example, picking a date), it can get tedious when you add an entry that’s set to 50g but you want to up it to 300g. Fortunately, FatSecret addressed this issue and now offers a nice input field.<p>

          <div class="caption">After — Input field</div>
        </div>
        <h4>3. Betterment</h4>
        <p>While you could always access your total net worth in the Betterment app, it used to be harder to find. You had to take several steps to get to it and it wasn’t visually standing out compared to other numbers. Now, however, you see it as soon as you log in. Even though I was at first surprised with the change, I now prefer seeing my overall financial picture right away instead of just Betterment investments.<p>

          <img style="width: 240px" src="images/3-4.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <h4>4. Wanderu</h4>
        <p>Wanderu sends a reminder two hours before your trip. While I haven’t forgotten about any of my upcoming trips (yet), this would definitely be useful if I ever did. In most cases, the two hour window would give me enough time to pack and get to the station. Aside from it being a potential life-saver, I still find this reminder useful because it makes clear the exact time of my departure. If I get a notification at 10:15am then I know for sure that my train is at 12:15pm, not 12:30pm and I don’t even have to check the ticket.</p>

        <p>* * *</p>
        <h3>Now let’s move on to the not so great ones:</h3>
        <h4>1. Uber/Lyft</h4>
        <p>This notification unnecessarily floods my feed and serves no purpose. As a user, I have no value in opening the app unless I need a ride. If Uber wants me to buy more rides, then they should send details right away, for example “30% off next 10 rides!” (I believe they used to do that). This will quickly get the point across and I’ll be more likely to think of Uber next time I need a ride. Ironically, I usually receive this notification together with an email, which specifies the offer details right in the subject line. As a result I end up with two Uber notifications at the same time — one from the app and on from the email. So even if I were interested enough in the deal to open the app, I wouldn’t have to, because the email already tells me everything I need to know.</p>

        </div>
        <p>P.S. I recently started seeing this from Lyft too.. Is this some sort of conspiracy?</p>

        </div>
        <p><b>!! 5.27 EDIT:</b></p>
        <p>Looks like Uber modified its emails and you can no longer see offer details in the subject line of the email. Check this out:</p>

        </div>
        <h4>2. Starbucks</h4>
        <p>I usually use the app to either pay in store or browse the menu. I very rarely use it to order ahead. Therefore, I always feel a bit uneasy when I just want to look at the menu, but have to go to the “Order” tab for it. To me, navigating to the tab implies taking the first step in the ordering process. However, in my case this is an undesirable flow, because I only want to look at the menu. In addition, I don’t want to accidentally place an order. I think it would be a better idea if the tab was named “Menu” instead, because then the user would feel free to browse as much as they want to but still be able to place an order.</p>

          <img style="width: 240px" src="images/3-10.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <h4>3. Flour</h4>
        <p>I also use Flour to either pay in bakery or browse the menu. While locating the menu is easy (there’s a tab called “Menu”, even though it’s hidden behind the burger menu!), I get lost when I want to pay in store. There’s a “pay in bakery” button right on the main screen but it blends with 3 other similar buttons and is quite faint compared to the big blue “Order” CTA. However, I expect to see a distinct “Pay in store” button. The problem here could be is that my mental model of cafe apps is primarily based on the layout of the Starbucks app, so I now expect to see it everywhere. Perhaps, if I didn’t use Starbucks app I would not have had this problem with Flour.</p>
