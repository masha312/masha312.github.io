      <h1>Minimal Map to Reflect on My Time in Boston</h1>

      <article>
        <p>One‚Äôs perception of the city they live in is shaped by surprisingly few trivial things: where they work, where they sleep, where they have fun, where they buy groceries, and perhaps where they work out or get their caffeine fix.</p>
        <p>As circumstances and physical surroundings change, the perception of the city changes as well, often in ways one can‚Äôt even imagine.</p>
        <p>With the fast pace of life, it‚Äôs sometimes hard to notice the shift and even more so, reflect on it.</p>
        <p>That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this article.</p>
        <p>I‚Äôve been in Boston for a while now, about six years. I never planned on moving here, yet here I am.</p>
        <p>I love it, most of the time. Other times, not so much.</p>
        <p>This city has seen me at my best and it has certainly seen me at my worst (perhaps a bit more than at my best).</p>
        <p>I want to be a part of it and I want to believe I am a part of it. However, sometimes I can‚Äôt help but think that I am kind of a ‚Äútransplant‚Äù, after all, and what I am <i>really</i> a part of is gentrification and rising housing prices.</p>
        <p>I moved here for school, found a tech job, and stayed. I live in one of those renovated triple-deckers in JP, because I can‚Äôt quite afford Back Bay.</p>
        <p>Aside from these superficial facts, it‚Äôs been a wild ride. This city is soaked with some beautiful and some painful memories.</p>
        <p><i>Red sunrises, long runs, T rides, friends, fake friends, rejections, hopeless thoughts, happy thoughts, wandering nights, too many coffee cups, lots of blue, lots of grey, lots of wind, lots of music, endorphins, dopamine.</i></p>
        <p>I‚Äôm the happiest here, for sure. I‚Äôm adaptive though, so I can be happy anywhere <i>I think</i> and looking back, I remember feeling happy even in the most miserable times.</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>Sometimes, as I pass by strangers on the street, I begin wondering what‚Äôs their story, why they are here, what‚Äôs their perception of this place.</p>
        <p>And I‚Äôve also been wanting to make a bit more sense of my own.</p>
        <p>Therefore, I made this map. It‚Äôs very low-key, not exactly accurate and yet, it‚Äôs been helpful in getting a bigger picture of my life here and reflecting on these past few years.</p>
        <p>Here it is:</p>

        <p>If you would like a little more insight on what these places are and what they mean to me, you‚Äôre more than welcome to continue on reading. Or, if you would like to make your own Boston map, you can do so too by duplicating the file from my <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/file/811338559057167620/Boston-map" target="_blank">Figma community profile</a> (you‚Äôll need a Figma account) and creating your own version of it. And if you do make one, please feel free to share the result.</p>

        <h3>Places, in chronological appearance</h3>
        <h4>Brandeis</h4>
        <p>Well, the reason I moved to Boston. I didn‚Äôt get into my dream school and Brandeis offered me an application waiver and a nice scholarship. I‚Äôve met some incredible people there and got a line on the resume that helped me land a job I love.</p>
        <p>That‚Äôs about it, really, and that‚Äôs more than enough.</p>
        <p>I didn‚Äôt even live there after my freshman year. Sometimes I wonder if I missed out on this whole college life thing. No regrets though, even if I did.</p>
        <h4>Boston Pole Fitness</h4>
        <p>The reason I didn‚Äôt go to a single college orientation. Learning to pole has been my dream the entire senior year of high school. The day after I moved to Brandeis, I went straight to this studio. BPF became my life for a few years. I was a student, then an instructor, then somehow became a manager. I competed in a pole competition and came in last. I burned out. I quit pole.</p>
        <h4>Swissb√§kers</h4>
        <p>Conveniently located right near the 70 bus stop on Western Ave. Great coffee, sandwiches, pretzels, desserts. Warmth. Shelter from wind and consolation for buses that never came. Lots of homework done there. I was sad when I found out they were closing. I‚Äôm happy they‚Äôre coming back.</p>
        <h4>Skin Studio</h4>
        <p>It‚Äôs like a lavender oasis in the middle of the city. Quiet place to reset, like a mini retreat. Laser, waxing, facials, good conversation ‚Äî they do it all. I used to spend all my extra money here. It‚Äôs worth every cent.</p>
        <h4>Central Wharf</h4>
        <p>Memories here range from the worst to <span title="888">one of the best</span>, with the best being the last. Don‚Äôt mind me, while I watch the planes take off.</p>
        <h4>Longwood Ave</h4>
        <p>A good friend of mine used to live there when he went to BU. Visiting him at his Longwood apt was my first introduction to Coolidge Corner and Brookline area in general. Little did I know that it would soon become my home.</p>
        <h4>Brainerd Rd</h4>
        <p>My first home in Boston. Got an email from a broker about this place at around 10pm <i>‚Ä¶while waiting for the bus at some random bus stop in Watertown</i>. Submitted application the following day at 4pm. Signed the lease the day after that. Those were some stressful 48 hours.</p>
        <p>I lived there for the next 3 years. I call this place <i>Die Traumbude</i>, in honor of Remarque‚Äôs novel. Ironically and coincidentally, our randomly assigned Starry wifi name was DreamyDream. It was meant to be.</p>
        <h4>The Ring</h4>
        <p>The best $40 investment of my life. The place I went to when I hit my lowest. Strengthened me physically, toughened me up mentally. And damn, the people there. They are awesome. ü•ä</p>
        <h4>Franklin Park</h4>
        <p>My first half marathon, BAA 2017. I remember running felt easy. Getting home was hard. I slept for 20 hours after. I thought I would never be able to do it again. I ran another half three weeks later.</p>
        <h4>Summit Ave</h4>
        <p>I owe my discovery of Summit Ave to Midnight Runners, who did one of their Sunday long runs there. That was one hot summer day‚Ä¶ I miss it.</p>
        <p>Many, many Summit Ave runs were to follow. <span title="888">The best was yet to come</span>.</p>
        <h4>Caff√® Paradiso</h4>
        <p>Another place to escape, to think. To work, to read a book, to write. To have a coffee or something sweeter. Once you‚Äôre inside, the outside world stops to matter much.</p>
        <h4>Drydock Ave</h4>
        <p>Work. Place that allowed me to realize my full potential, which I feel incredibly grateful for.</p>
        <h4>7 Pond Coffee Bar</h4>
        <p>A few Saturday mornings were spent there ‚Äî writing articles, watching cute dogs out the window. Coffee is good too.</p>
        <p>Among the other trendy coffee shops all around, this one feels more genuine (or ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù, if that‚Äôs the word you want to use).</p>
        <h4>Boston Ballet School</h4>
        <p>I used to dance as a child, so when I started taking classes at Boston Ballet, it surely brought a great deal of nostalgia. Our instructor also treats us like children (in the best possible way) which makes me feel warm and fuzzy on the inside, every single time.</p>
        <h4>Glen Rd</h4>
        <p>Home. I was looking for a new apt, so of course I posted an ad on Craigslist. These two guys needed third roommate and they saw my posting. It worked out nicely, wasn‚Äôt even a scam. They are really cool.</p>
        <h4>Mike‚Äôs Fitness</h4>
        <p>The place where I lift weights and preserve my sanity.<p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>If you read all of the above, wow and thank you.</p>
        <p>If you end up <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/file/811338559057167620/Boston-map" target="_blank">making your own map</a>, once again, I would <i>love</i> to see it.
