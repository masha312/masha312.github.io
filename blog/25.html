        <p>While I’ve always wanted to try intermittent fasting, I could never figure out how to fit it in my (pre-quarantine) life. Prior to March, my schedule looked something like this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wake up at 5, eat, go to the gym.</li>
          <li>Get to work by 9, have coffee with a protein bar (yummm).</li>
          <li>Have lunch at around 1–2.</li>
          <li>Get home by 7, do some errands/work/study, have dinner.</li>
          <li>Go to bed at around 10.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Clearly, I never even had as little as 12 hours pass between eating.</p>
        <p>Once quarantine started, things changed. I stopped waking up at 5. I decided to take a break from strength training and got back into yoga and running. I figured that maybe it’s worth to give intermittent fasting another chance.</p>
        <p><i>Note: I say “intermittent fasting”, but perhaps “intermittent not-eating” would be a more accurate term. I still drink my coffee with milk during my non-eating hours, which technically breaks the fast.</i></p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>As of today, I’ve been intermittent “fasting” for about 4–5 weeks, having my first meal at around 9–11 and my last between 2–5. My fasting window is usually between 14–20 hours long. Here’s what my life looks like now:
        <ul>
          <li>Wake up at 7, go on a walk or run, get coffee.</li>
          <li>Get home by 9, have breakfast, work.</li>
          <li>Go on a walk at 1-ish.</li>
          <li>Have lunch at 2 or 3.</li>
          <li>Do some yoga or run after work.</li>
          <li>If there’s still time, go on another walk or study/work.</li>
          <li>Go to bed at around 10.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>I’ve read a lot about intermittent fasting prior to starting this experiment and tried a few 24-hour fasts. Based on the reading and my previous experience, I obviously had some expectations going into this. Some things came true, some didn’t, and some were totally unexpected.</p>
        <p>With that being said, here are my reflections on these past four weeks.</p>
        <h3>Reflection 1 — On finding the right fasting schedule</h3>
        <p>I thought that the easiest way would be to fast 9pm-1pm, because, well, isn’t that what most people do? I tried that the first couple days though and had a very hard time. I couldn’t even imagine sticking to it long term. I didn’t think it was a timing problem at first and was ready to give up on fasting altogether. However, I did give it another shot and tried skipping dinner instead of breakfast. Surprisingly, I enjoyed this setup so much more. Moreover, I realized that I usually don’t want to eat in the evening anyway and would much rather do other stuff. How come have I not noticed it before?</p>
        <h3>Reflection 2 — On falling asleep</h3>
        <p>Another reason I was initially hesitant about trying an evening fast is because I thought I would be too hungry to fall asleep. It turned out to not be an issue at all — in fact, I sleep way better now.</p>
        <h3>Reflection 3 —On letting hunger go</h3>
        <p>Though this one is widely known, I really had to experience it myself. I always thought that once you get hungry, the feeling doesn’t leave until you eat. However, it does. And even when it comes back, it leaves again. I also noticed that with time it becomes easier to pay less attention to the hunger spikes. It’s amazing.</p>
        <h3>Reflection 4 —On letting hangriness go</h3>
        <p>Given the above, I also now feel less hangry than ever. I realized that hangriness isn’t caused by the hunger itself but rather by anxiety that comes from thinking that I need to eat.</p>
        <h3>Reflection 5 —On not being a foodie</h3>
        <p>Over the past few years, I started to notice that I don’t have much interest in food. I’m not really into going to restaurants to try different things. I’m okay eating the same food all the time. I never feel inclined to have holiday-specific treats to fully enjoy that holiday. I’m not going to have FOMO if I don’t have [<i>insert something here</i>] on a national [<i>insert that same something</i>] day. I can spend hours at a grocery store studying packaging for chocolate bars, without wanting to eat the chocolate itself. I think food should taste good but not too good, so it doesn’t prevent me from feeling comfortably full before getting too full. Food is fuel and that’s about it.</p>
        <p>Fasting helped me come to these realizations even more so.</p>
        <p>Admittedly though, I do think food is much more enjoyable when you have it with somebody really special. 🥯</p>
        <h3>Reflection 6 — On breathing</h3>
        <p>This one I noticed back when I did a few 24-hour fasts about a year ago and it’s the # 1 reason why I love fasting. Breathing just starts to feel so, so, so differently. It’s like I’m on a runner’s high all the time.</p>
        <h3>Reflection 7 — On staying calm and concentrated</h3>
        <p>Things that caused stress before suddenly don’t matter. And for things that still do matter, it becomes so much easier to concentrate and find solutions.</p>
        <h3>Reflection 8 — On layering up</h3>
        <p>Sometimes I start feeling very cold when I’m fasting (especially if I go over the 16 hour mark) and can wear my winter jacket even if it’s 50 outside. Although apparently it’s a <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-nutr-071816-064634" target="_blank">common side effect</a>, I didn’t see this one coming at all.</p>
        <h3>Reflection 9 —On hydrating</h3>
        <p>I also didn’t expect to feel very dehydrated. This one makes sense though — even though I usually don’t drink a lot of water, I think I get a lot of it from fruits and vegetables. Since that water source is no longer an option when I’m fasting, I really want to drink more.</p>
        <h3>Reflection 10 — On being around others</h3>
        <p>I thought it would be hard to see somebody eat whenever I’m not eating and that I would get jealous and would want to eat too 🙃 I haven’t felt that way (yet) though. In fact, I found that the hardest part is to convince the other person is that they absolutely shouldn’t feel bad or worry about eating around me and that it’s really not a big deal.</p>
        <h3>Reflection 11 — On running</h3>
        <p>Prior to this fasting experiment, I avoided running on an empty stomach because I was afraid of getting dizzy. That was so wrong. I’ve done a few fasted runs now and they are absolutely euphoric ✨</p>
        <h3>Reflection 12 — On listening to music</h3>
        <p>Even listening to music is different. It becomes much easier to separate musical instruments into their own separate threads and then go back and forth between them, focusing just on one at a time. It feels like I’m rediscovering my favorite songs all over again. 💓</p>
        <h3>Reflection 13 — On setting no limits</h3>
        <p>I don’t think I would have gotten through these past four weeks if I tried to stick to a stricter schedule. Though I usually aim for 16 hours every day, I allow myself to break the fast after 14 or even 12 hours if that feels right. Likewise, if I want to keep going, I go longer.</p>
