        <p>~Without stressing out~</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>A few months ago I wrote an article on how to stay consistent with workouts. Although the advice there is meant to be general, I was mostly considering my approach to weekday workouts when I was writing it. Weekends, however, are a whole other universe.</p>
        <p>Therefore, I decided to write this post, focusing primarily on how to make workouts work on the weekends as well.</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>First, here's a bit of my backgroundâ€Š-â€Šperhaps it's somewhat similar to yours.</p>
        <p>At this point, I can say that I ironed out my weekday routine quite well. The moment I get up, I feel energized and ready to work out. My meals are perfectly planned and I know exactly what to eat and when to make sure I perform my best. I follow a specific strength training program so I know what to expect every day and never have to think or worry about what to do at the gym. There's a solid structure to my weekdays.</p>
        <p>(Un)fortunately, weekends lack that structure. For a while I've been trying to create a weekend-specific routine to follow but haven't been successful. Weekends are never really the same, and something always comes up. I was upset and frustrated about it at first, until I realized that it's a good thing, after all, and maybe I should just <i>chill out</i> and take a more relaxed approach to my weekend workouts.</p>
        <p>Weekends are meant to be different. It's the time to rest, hang out with family and friends, and do something that you don't have the opportunity to do during the week. Weekends don't need structure.</p>
        <p>With that being said, the first tip isâ€¦</p>
        <h3>Accept that it might be different everyÂ time</h3>
        <p>For sure, you can plan to work out every Saturday morning. But let's say you had a few drinks on Friday, went to bed late, and now that Saturday morning is definitely not happening.</p>
        <p>And guess what? That's okay. You had a fun Friday night and that what matters.</p>
        <p>Sleep in, rest up, and maybe you'll be able to get one in the afternoon or in the evening. Just go with the flow.</p>
        <p>Or maybe you end up running errands the entire afternoon and don't get one in at all. That's also fine. You don't have to work out every weekend and taking a rest day is only good for your body. Remember that after all, you spent the past five days working out and will be back into the grind once Monday comes anyway.</p>
        <h3>Explore something new</h3>
        <p>While it's good to have a set workout program, it's also important to switch it up once in a while to keep yourself challenged. If you do the same exercises all the time, eventually you'll get used to them and they will no longer be as effective.</p>
        <p>In order to make sure you don't hit a training plateau, make it your goal to explore and try something new. Weekends are perfect for that.</p>
        <p>For example, I love doing kettlebell workouts. After a while though, I found that I was doing the same exercises over and over and while I enjoyed them, they no longer challenged me. So, I looked up creative KB exercises and decided to try them out. However, since I'm too crunched on time during the weekday workouts, I had to wait for the weekend to experiment with the new kettlebell stuff.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, it made me really look forward to the weekend and I was more excited than usual to get to the gym on Saturday. Ever since then, I've been following the same strategyâ€Š-â€Šlooking up new fun workouts during the week and saving them for the weekend. Works like charm.</p>
        <p>Also, after I get a chance to really take my time with something new during the weekend, I feel more comfortable incorporating it in my weekday workouts. This way I'm constantly challenging myself and never get bored during the week as well.</p>

        <h3>Explore something new, like, veryÂ new</h3>
        <p>Another way to remain active during the weekend is to try something completely new. Instead of going to your regular gym, hit up some other place. Maybe go rockclimbing or take a ballet class or a hot yoga class or a boxing class. Look up gyms in your area and see what they offer. Many of them will probably have "first class free" or a similar deal, so take advantage of those.</p>
        <h3>Do it with aÂ friend</h3>
        <p>On days when there's no set routine to stick to, it greatly pays to have an accountability partner. If you plan to work out with someone, you will probably be more likely to stay committed and get it done.</p>
        <p>This could also be a good way to hang out with somebody you don't see often during the week, so it's a win-win.</p>
        <h3>Have some great tunesÂ ready</h3>
        <p>This one isn't just for the weekend, obviously.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I feel that I don't give music enough credit and yet it's what makes my workout truly a good one and helps me find my flow.</p>
        <p>(If you're looking for some great tunes, here's my ultimate <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/everything/pl.u-DdANrYNCNYKNyj" target="_blank">playlist</a> of endorphin-pumping songs ðŸŽ¼).</p>
        <h3>Lastly, maybe just take aÂ break</h3>
        <p>As said above (and as you probably already know), rest days are necessary in helping your body recover. Therefore, once in a while, skip your weekend workout. Maybe even spend the entire day laying in bed, watching movies, reading, or just being lazy. And if you really want to get some activity in, go on a long walk or a hike.</p>
        <p>Skipping one weekend will only make you more excited to hit the gym the following week ðŸŽ‰</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <h3>The mainÂ takeaway</h3>
        <p>What helped me most in remaining consistent with my weekend workouts is changing my mindset about them. While I did get my weekend workouts in before, I always tried to make them work perfectly, like the weekday ones, and that stressed me out. I left no room flexibility, didn't try anything new, and was often burned out working out midway the following week. That's not a healthy way to go about it.</p>
        <p>If you find yourself having the same problem, hopefully the above tips will helpÂ :) Thank you for reading.</p>
