        <h3>The Human Scale</h3>
        <div class="article-image">

          <div class="caption">The Human Scale (2012), produced by Signe Byrge Sørensen</div>
        </div>
        <p><i>The Human Scale</i> questions our assumptions about modernity, exploring what happens when we put people into the center of our equations. For 40 years the Danish architect Jan Gehl has systematically studied human behavior in cities. His starting point was an interest in people, more than buildings - in what he called Life Between Buildings. What made it exist? When was it destroyed? How could it be brought back? This lead to studies of how human beings use the streets, how they walk, see, rest, meet, interact etc. Jan Gehl also uses statistics, but the questions he asks are different. For instance: How many people pass this street throughout a 24 hour period? How many percent of those are pedestrians? How many are driving cars or bikes? How much of the street space are the various groups allowed to use? Is this street performing well for all its users? 
        Jan Gehl made his first studies in Italy and later he inspired the planning of Denmark's capital, Copenhagen, for 40 years. His ideas inspired the creation of walking streets, the building and improvements of bike paths and the reorganization of parks, squares and other public spaces throughout this city and in many other cities in the Nordic region. Around the world cities like Melbourne, Dhaka, New York, Chongqing and Christchurch are now also being inspired by Gehl's work and by the developments in Copenhagen.</p>

        <h3>Urbanized</h3>

        </div>
        <p>Over half the world's population now lives in an urban area, and 75% will call a city home by 2050. But while some cities are experiencing explosive growth, others are shrinking. The challenges of balancing housing, mobility, public space, civic engagement, economic development, and environmental policy are fast becoming universal concerns. Yet much of the dialogue on these issues is disconnected from the public domain.</p>
        <p>Who is allowed to shape our cities, and how do they do it? Unlike many other fields of design, cities aren't created by any one specialist or expert. There are many contributors to urban change, including ordinary citizens who can have a great impact improving the cities in which they live. By exploring a diverse range of urban design projects around the world, Urbanized frames a global discussion on the future of cities.</p>

        <h3>My Brooklyn</h3>
        <div class="article-image">
          <img style="width: 100%" src="images-movies/m-2.jpg"/>
          <div class="caption">My Brooklyn (2012), produced by Kelly Anderson</div>
        </div>
        <p><i>My Brooklyn</i> is a documentary about Director Kelly Anderson's personal journey, as a Brooklyn "gentrifier," to understand the forces reshaping her neighborhood along lines of race and class. The story begins when Anderson moves to Brooklyn in 1988, lured by cheap rents and bohemian culture. By Michael Bloomberg's election as mayor in 2001, a massive speculative real estate boom is rapidly altering the neighborhoods she has come to call home. She watches as an explosion of luxury housing and chain store development spurs bitter conflict over who has a right to live in the city and to determine its future. While some people view these development patterns as ultimately revitalizing the city, to others, they are erasing the eclectic urban fabric, economic and racial diversity, creative alternative culture, and unique local economies that drew them to Brooklyn in the first place. It seems that no less than the city's soul is at stake.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, development officials announce a controversial plan to tear down and remake the Fulton Mall, a popular and bustling African-American and Caribbean commercial district just blocks from Anderson's apartment. She discovers that the Mall, despite its run-down image, is the third most profitable shopping area in New York City with a rich social and cultural history. As the local debate over the Mall's future intensifies, deep racial divides in the way people view neighborhood change become apparent. All of this pushes Anderson to confront her own role in the process of gentrification, and to investigate the forces behind it more deeply.</p>
        <p>She meets with government officials, urban planners, developers, advocates, academics, and others who both champion and criticize the plans for Fulton Mall. Only when Anderson meets Brooklyn-born and raised scholar Craig Wilder, though, who explains his family's experiences of neighborhood change over generations, does Anderson come to understand that what is happening in her neighborhoods today is actually a new chapter in an old American story. The film's ultimate questions become how to heal the deep racial wounds embedded in our urban development patterns, and how citizens can become active in fixing a broken planning process.</p>

        <h3>Bill Cunningham New York</h3>

        </div>
        <p>"We all get dressed for Bill," says <i>Vogue</i> editrix Anna Wintour.</p>
        <p>The "Bill" in question is 80+ <i>New York Times</i> photographer Bill Cunningham. For decades, this Schwinn-riding cultural anthropologist has been obsessively and inventively chronicling fashion trends and high society charity soirées for the <i>Times</i> Style section in his columns "On the Street" and "Evening Hours." Documenting uptown fixtures (Wintour, Tom Wolfe, Brooke Astor, David Rockefeller - who all appear in the film out of their love for Bill), downtown eccentrics and everyone in between, Cunningham's enormous body of work is more reliable than any catwalk as an expression of time, place and individual flair. In turn, <i>Bill Cunningham New York</i> is a delicate, funny and often poignant portrait of a dedicated artist whose only wealth is his own humanity and unassuming grace.

        <h3>Rams</h3>

        </div>
        <p>For over fifty years, Dieter Rams has left an indelible mark on the field of product design and the world at large with his iconic work at Braun and Vitsoe. The objects Dieter has designed have touched the lives of millions of people - so many of us have had a Braun coffeemaker, shaver, stereo, calculator, speakers, or alarm clock. Or an Oral-B toothbrush. Or a Vitsoe 606 shelving system. Or any of the hundreds of other products Dieter has designed or overseen the design of.</p>
        <p>His work has influenced the way most of today's consumer products look and function. The computer or phone you're reading this on looks the way it does because of Dieter Rams. Dieter's influence also extends to his <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design" target="_blank">"Ten Principles of Good Design"</a>, a list of edicts that champions simplicity, honesty, and restraint, and still applies to design theory and practice today.</p>

        <h3>Abstract: The Art of Design</h3>
        <p>Netflix original documentary series highlighting artists in the field of design, created by Scott Dadich. While all 14 episodes are amazing, the following three deserve a special highlight:</p>
        <h4>Christoph Niemann: Illustration</h4>

        </div>
        <p>From <i>New Yorker</i> covers to Instagram sketches, illustrator Christoph Niemann plays with abstraction and interactivity - and questions authenticity.</p>

        <h3>The Infinite Happiness</h3>

          <div class="caption">The Infinite Happiness (2015), produced by Ila Bêka and Louise Lemoine</div>
        </div>
        <p>Conceived as a personal video diary, <i>The Infinite Happiness</i> is an architectural experience. The film takes us to the heart of one of the contemporary housing development considered to be a new model of success.</p>
        <p>Inhabiting the giant "8 House" built by Danish architect Bjarke Ingels in the suburbs of Copenhagen, Ila Bêka & Louise Lemoine recount their subjective experience of living inside this experiment of vertical village, elected in 2011 « World best residential building ».</p>
        <p>As a Lego game, the film builds up a collection of life stories all interconnected by their personal relation to the building. The film draws the lines of a human map which allows the viewer to discover the building through an inner and intimate point of view and questions the architecture's ability to create collective happiness showing the surprising results of this new type of social model of the 21rst century.</p>

        <p>In this funny and thought-provoking talk, Janette Sadik-Khan, transportation commissioner of New York City, shares projects that have reshaped street life in the 5 boroughs, including pedestrian zones in Times Square, high-performance buses and a 6,000-cycle-strong bike share. Her mantra: Do bold experiments that are cheap to try out.</p>

        <h3>How architecture can create dignity for all</h3>
        <div class="article-image">

        </div>
        <p>If architect and writer John Cary has his way, women will never need to stand in pointlessly long bathroom lines again. Lines like these are representative of a more serious issue, Cary says: the lack of diversity in design that leads to thoughtless, compassionless spaces. Design has a unique ability to dignify and make people feel valued, respected, honored and seen - but the flip side is also true. Cary calls for architects and designers to expand their ranks and commit to serving the public good, not just the privileged few. "Well-designed spaces are not just a matter of taste or a questions of aesthetics," he says. "They literally shape our ideas about who we are in the world and what we deserve." And we all deserve better.</p>

        <p>What do the roof of a hotel in Lhasa, the Steve Jobs biography, Kindle book covers, Borges, and Alan Kay have to do with each other? Almost nothing, but if you squint hard enough, you'll see they're all concerned with boundaries and edges. Together we'll squint and tilt our heads and try to see how edges around data and content change the way we should think about and design for books in the age of the iPad.</p>
