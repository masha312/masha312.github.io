        <p>The hardest part about going to the gym is physically getting there. Especially in the morning. Especially in December.</p>
        <p>Waking up, resisting the snooze button, getting out of warm bed… So hard.</p>
        <p>Therefore, before we dive into things you can do <i>at</i> the gym, let’s first <i>get ourselves there</i>.</p>
        <h3>Secrets for getting to the gym, especially in the am</h3>
        <h4>~Get up the moment you hear the alarm~</h4>
        <p>Throw off the blanket and literally get up. No mind games for this one. The longer you stay in bed, the harder it is to get up. You start thinking about how nice the bed is, how you can go to the gym another day, how you can sleep just five more minutes. This is a no-no. Don’t let yourself think. <i>Get up before you wake up</i>. Once you’re physically up, the desire to go back to sleep drops significantly.</p>
        <h4>~Experiment with your alarms~</h4>
        <p>Personally, I don’t like abruptly waking up to a loud alarm sound (who does?). I find that setting a silent (vibrating) alarm on my Fitbit works much better by helping me wake up rather gradually. If you want to take this even one step further, you can try out a smart alarm (alarm that tracks your stages of sleep and wakes you up during your lightest sleep phase). Although I’ve never used one, I’ve only heard good things about it.</p>
        <h4>~Get adequate sleep~</h4>
        <p>Go to bed early, make sure it’s not too hot in the room, don’t eat a lot before bed, etc. I won’t get too much into that, since there are already tons of articles on this topic.</p>
        <h4>~Eat, maybe?~</h4>
        <p>I am one of those people that wakes up with their stomach growling. No matter how early it is, I want to eat. At some point, I used to work out fasted and although it comes with some health benefits and works for a lot of people, it doesn’t work for me. Yeah, maybe I get to burn more fat but is it worth it if I’m hangry, feeling weak, rush through my workouts and can only think about food? Probably not.<br/>
        These days, I eat about 60g of chicken breast with some dry roasted edamame and popcorn before heading to the gym. It’s a weird snack, I know. Especially at 5am. It works though. It makes me look forward getting to the gym and also excited and ready for my workout.</p>
        <h4>~Prep your gym bag the night before~</h4>
        <p>First, it’ll get you in “I’m going to the gym in the morning” mindset. Second, you’ll have less to think about in the morning.</p>
        <h3>Secrets for beating workout scaries</h3>
        <p>You know Sunday scaries? Well, I have <i>workout</i> scaries.</p>
        <p>I get nervous <i>every single time</i> before I work out. I feel as if I won’t be able to complete it. I feel like I’m not going to perform as well as before. Not gonna be as fast, not gonna lift as much, not gonna last as long, blah blah blah.</p>
        <p>So, here are a few of my fears and things I say to myself to combat them:</p>
        <h4>Fear: “I won’t be able to do this because I don’t feel like jumping around and doing cardio, I just feel too tired.”</h4>
        <p>Response: “Well, what do I feel like doing? Maybe I would much rather do a nice calm lift... Perhaps I could modify my workout to omit jumps from exercises and add heavier weights instead. Or I could even do less reps with heavier weights as well.”</p>
        <h4>Fear: “I don’t want to do heavy weights today, my body is not capable of lifting things and putting them back down. Even the thought of it makes me feel exhausted.”</h4>
        <p>Response: “Well, that’s okay. How about I don’t push too much on weights, even go lower than usual, and instead concentrate on engagement and form? I could also add a few stretches in between circuits to help the body recover. And If I feel like getting my heart rate up, I could throw in some burpees or jumping jacks between the rounds.”</p>
        <h4>Fear: “How do I manage to work out for over an hour? There’s no way I will be able to do it today.”</h4>
        <p>Response: “If I don’t want a long work out, that’s fine. I will cut my circuits by 1–2 rounds and just go for 30 minutes. Anything is better than nothing.”</p>
        <h4>Fear: “I just can’t do it.”</h4>
        <p>Response: “I’ve done it hundreds of times before. There’s no reason I wouldn’t be able to do it today.” (Number doesn’t matter! Even if you’ve done it once before, <i>you’ve done it</i> nevertheless).</p>
        <p>Making adjustments and modifying workouts based on how I feel usually works well and I still end up with quality workouts. Moreover, often once I start working out, I realize that my fears were just fears and I’m definitely capable of going faster/lifting heavier/staying longer.</p>
        <h3>Secrets for staying motivated</h3>
        <p>Motivation alone doesn’t do much. It comes and goes. Discipline is the true key to consistency. However, in order to keep ourselves disciplined, sometimes we need <i>some</i> motivation.</p>
        <h4>~Intrinsic motivation~</h4>
        <p>In the end, you only working out only for yourself and it’s great freedom to be able to do that. You have nothing to prove to anyone. You do it because you love it. You love how it makes you feel during and afterwards, how it clears your mind, how it benefits your health. You love how it makes you stronger both physically snd mentally, how it gives you a confidence boost and makes you feel ready to tackle whatever life throws at you. Intrinsic motivation rarely goes, it’s always there. You can always rely on it and that’s an amazing thing.</p>
        <h4>~Numbers~</h4>
        <p>Numbers are great way to visualize your progress. The trick is to pick the right metric. Scale? Probably not, not for me at least. Weights? Hell yeah. There’s no better feeling than realizing that what once felt too heavy now feels too light.<br/>
        If weights are not your thing, there are tons of ways out there to measure your progress, depending on your workout goals. Maybe it’s your running pace? Or waist circumference? Resting heart rate? Anything goes. Just make sure it benefits you positively.</p>
        <h4>~Coffee~</h4>
        <p>A good cup of coffee after a good workout is always a nice little reward. Especially when shared with your fellow early risers (looking at you, Ring fam).</p>
        <h4>~People~</h4>
        <p>Working out is always more fun when you do it with someone. On the worst days, this is what keeps me going (looking at you again, Ring fam).</p>
        <h4>~Checkmarks~</h4>
        <p>At the beginning of every week, I like to write down my intended workouts and then check them off as I complete them. While it’s nothing fancy, it is oddly satisfying to check a box off and there’s definitely been a few times when I went to work out just to keep the streak going.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>Secrets for pushing yourself harder</h3>
        <h4>Heavier weights? Less reps</h4>
        <p>As much as I enjoy progressing in weights, it’s always hard for me to convince myself to go for a heavier weight. Sometimes, however, I have no other choice when the dumbbells/kettlebells I was planning on using are already taken by somebody else.</p>
        <p>When that happens, I usually tell myself that I will just cut back on the reps and simply do as many as I can with heavier weights.</p>
        <p>Ironically, most of the time I end up completing the planned set of reps. Even with higher weights.</p>
        <h4>One step at a time</h4>
        <p>My workouts consist of three to four 2–4-round circuits, with 2–4 exercises in each circuit (hopefully example below will make it clear). I love this set up, because it allows me to concentrate on one thing at a time without getting overwhelmed by all the things I plan on doing.</p>
        <p>Once circuit at a time. One round at a time. One rep at a time.</p>
        <p>This mindset helps me stay in the present and give it all I got. This way, I know that even if I run out of time and have to skip the last round or even the last circuit, I still get a balanced workout.</p>

          <div class="caption">Insta screenshot of one of my workouts. Yes, I do like Rammstein… if you’re German, I sincerely apologize.</div>
        </div>
        <h4>Count matters</h4>
        <p>How you count reps matters a lot. I’ve even noticed that depending on how I count I may or may not complete a set without breaks.</p>
        <p>For example, if I have to do 10 push ups, there are several ways I can count them:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I could go in ascending order and do 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</li>
          <li>I could go in descending order and do 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</li>
          <li>Or I could do 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I found that this latter count is the most effective. It helps me to mentally break up the set into two. When I start out, I think “oh, I only have to get to five” and once I get to the second part, I think “oh, I only have five more to go”.</p>
        <h3>Secrets to keeping it interesting</h3>
        <p>Some say that going to the gym is boring. I used to think so as well and preferred exclusively fun workouts to simply going to the gym (boxing! pole! rock climbing!).</p>
        <p>I was so wrong though. Now I love going to the gym just as much as doing the above workouts.</p>
        <h4>Cardio + weights = 🔥</h4>
        <p>As I mentioned above, I like to break my workout into several circuits. Each circuit consists of 2–4 exercises, some of which a more cardio-based and some are strength-based. For example, if I’m working out legs, I could do a circuit that consists of burpees (cardio), squats (weights), squat jumps (cardio), and hip thrusts (weights). This keeps it engaging and allows me to catch a break from one type of exercise to another.</p>
        <h4>Switch it up</h4>
        <p>Equipment is interchangeable. You can do deadlifts with a barbell or with dumbbells or with kettlebells. You can do lat pulldowns with cable or with a band. Switching it up will help you perfect your form and challenge you in new ways. Needless to say, it’ll also teach you to be flexible and modify your workouts on the go since you’ll no longer be depended on specific equipment to complete an exercise (no more worrying that the cable machine you wanted to use is occupied by somebody else!).</p>
        <h4>Switch it up part 2</h4>
        <p>Every exercise can be modified. For example, deadlifts. You can do a regular deadlift. Or you can do a single leg deadlift. Or you can do a deadlift with upright row. Modifications are endless. If you find that you are starting to get bored with your existing routine, look at how you can enhance your exercises to make it more fun and challenging.</p>
        <h4>Treadmills can be fun</h4>
        <p>Even though going on a treadmill is a great way to warm up your body before a work out, it can get really boring really quick — even if you go for 15 minutes or so. Therefore, I usually try to mix up different things I can do on a treadmill in order to make my 15-minute warm up fly by faster. For example, I can do something like this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Minute 1–3: run at comfortable speed (~6.2 m/h for me)</li>
          <li>Minute 4: increase speed (~6.4 m/h)</li>
          <li>Minute 5: increase speed (~6.7 m/h)</li>
          <li>Minute 6: shuffle on the right side (please try this at a low speed first to get used to turning your body on a treadmill and avoid any injuries. I do this at ~4.3 m/h)</li>
          <li>Minute 7: shuffle on the left side ( ~4.3 m/h)</li>
          <li>Minute 8: run at comfortable speed (~6.4 m/h)</li>
          <li>Minute 9: run fast, increasing speed every 20sec (7.5–8 m/h)</li>
          <li>Minute 10: lower the speed a little bit (~6.7 m/h)</li>
          <li>Minutes 11–12: shuffle (~4.3 m/h)</li>
          <li>Minute 13: run fast, increasing speed every 20sec (~7.7–8.2 m/h)</li>
          <li>Minute 14: lower the speed (~6.7 m/h)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of course, there are numerous combinations. So play around with it, find what works for you, and beat the treadmill boredom!</p>
        <h4>Jump rope</h4>
        <p>I learned to jump rope when I started taking boxing classes and now it’s one of my favorite exercises. It takes some time to master and there are many different ways you can do it. I love adding it as a cardio burst to my circuits or using it to warm up on days when all I <i>really</i> don’t want to go on the treadmill (or when treadmills are occupied).</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>These are just some of the things I do that help me hit the gym consistently and enjoy my time there. I hope you found something useful here :)</p>
        <p>Thank you for reading and let’s get those endorphins flowing 💪</p>
