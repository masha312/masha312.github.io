            <h3>About me, what I am</h3>
            <p>I take abstract concepts and work on them until they turn into concrete and comprehensible visuals. I think by doing, as it's the simplest way to not get lost in illusions. I remain calm under stressful situations (ask me how). I'm not attached to <strike>my</strike> designs (it's a team effort, after all). I never stop exploring the unfamiliar and so, I am able to make clear connections between the most unrelated ideas.</p>

          <div class="block" id="section-2">
            <h3>About me, what I am not</h3>
              <p>I don't have 5-8 years of experience.</p>
              <p>However, I put a lot time and effort into learning. I've always been ahead of my age, both by nature and by circumstances.</p>
              <p>I'm not talkative, when there are 3+ people in the room. I like to listen, process, analyze. I'm much better when it comes to talking one-on-one though. And I'm really good to be silent with.</p>
              <p>Despite my quietness, I'm not afraid to disagree. I expect others to do the same about my work, because it shows that they care.</p>
              <p>At times, I spend too much time trying to fix a problem on my own before going to someone else for advice. I realize that sometimes it's better to ask for help right away. I'm learning how to better recognize those situations.</p>

          <h3>Work, summary</h3>
          <p>I brought design to my current company. I created a design system and implemented a usability testing process with customers and company analysts. I started working with CX team to come up with a better copy for our app, and I modified our color scheme to meet contrast requirements. I wrote component styles in our codebase to make implementation easier for devs and removed tons of duplicated code (oddly satisfying feeling, isn't?).</p>
          <p>I exposed design. I onboarded <span title="~30 people, we're small">half</span> of the company to Figma and made a slack channel for anyone to join and engage in design conversations. This allowed people who previously thought they didn't an influence to have their voice heard. They can vent their frustrations, participate in polls, share inspiration from other apps and websites, and check out upcoming features in early design stages.</p>

          <h3>My Basecamp story</h3>
          <p>Signal v. Noise is one of the reasons I can show off my accomplishments above.</p>
          <p>Back when I was finishing up my last year in college, I got a software engineering internship at my current company. Even though I always wanted to do a hybrid of dev and design, I found that it was surprisingly difficult. First, it was hard to figure out how to create that perfect blend without disrupting other people's jobs in the process. Second, design was an afterthought.</p>
          <p>Countless times I remember walking to work and being torn between the choice of whether to stay in my lane OR take risks and attempt to fill the gaps I saw.</p>
          <p>Every time I wanted to back down, I thought "what would those guys at Basecamp do, what would they think?". The fact that somebody out there shared my beliefs and values helped me to keep pushing forward.</p>

          <h3>Hey, I'm so ready</h3>
          <p>To grow, to learn from more experienced than I am.</p>

          <p>To challenge Gmail, Yahoo, Yandex. To show that there's always an option to do things differently, in an ethical and transparent way.</p>
          <p>Basecamp is the place to be. To grow, to create, to question.</p>
